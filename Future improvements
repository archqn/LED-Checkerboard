Improvements:
- 5v power supply for LED instead of 9v (reduces need for voltage regulator which can overheat if used for too long)
- stronger magnets in checkers pieces for more consistent readings
- better mechanism for keeping the mylar board flat and propped up and keeping the reed switch grid directly under the mylar board

Future directions:
- can be designed for chess as well as checkers
- rules can be coded so LEDs respond when a wrong move is made
- can be coded to track the positions of pieces as well and serialprint the board state to a monitor or other API
