# LED-Checkerboard
Beginner Arduino project - checkerboard that tracks the last piece moved and lights up the square it moved from and the new square it was moved to.

First year undergraduate project for ECE 5 - Introduction to Electrical & Computer Engineering at University of California Santa Barbara.

~4 week project. Approximate start date: 11/02/2023. Approximate completion date: 11/05/2023
