Design Timeline
Week 5: 
Experimented with reed switches by creating a circuit with the reed switch and LED with the Arduino. 
Decided on the type of sensors to be used, which were glass reed switches instead of plastic. 
Used TinkerCAD to begin writing the code and making a mock circuit system with buttons instead of switches. 
Ordered the switches, LEDs, and checkerboard. 
Week 6: 
Assembled a grid system with buttons while waiting for the reed switches to arrive
Tested the circuit to see if the Arduino could read the position of the on/off buttons
Met with Roark, Srini, and Monsij to determine what kind of methods we should tackle with the code and whether or not we should use a diode
Created a sketch for our code
Week 7: 
Soldered reed switches to diodes
Completed 7 rows of the grid system
Ordered Mylar Sheet
Completed code and tested it once with the first two rows of the system
Successfully read the switches
Week 8: 
Finished all 8 rows of the grid system and taped it down a piece of cardboard
Plugged in all wires of the grid to the Arduino and tested if all the sensors were working
Un-taped the grid system and taped the LED strip underneath in a snake-pattern
Adjusted the code to accommodate the LED pattern and assign positions to each LED. 
Drew and cut a checkered pattern on the Mylar Sheet
Week 9: 
Finished assembling the grid on top of the LED snake
Plugged in the grid circuit and LEDs and tested the code, making adjustments
Taped the Mylar sheet to the grid.
